# README
This repository is intended as a presentable container for experiments, tutorials and scratchpads using the __three.js__ 3D rendering library.

__The vision:__ a simple landing page with links to view each "playground".
__The goal:__ to mess around, mess up, play around, create something stupid, create something brilliant, and hopefully have some fun.
